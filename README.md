Vitala

Vitala is a smart health reminder app designed to help users maintain consistent daily health habits such as medication intake, hydration, exercise, sleep, and self-care routines. Unlike basic reminder apps, Vitala focuses on habit continuity and user wellbeing by delivering timely, context-aware nudges that adapt to the user’s schedule and behavior. The app aims to reduce missed health actions, improve routine adherence, and support long-term wellness through simple, reliable reminders.
